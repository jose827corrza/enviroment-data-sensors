# Mini environmental station with Raspberry Pi Pico

Using as main processor the Raspberry Pi, collects data using sensors different nature magnitudes, such as temperature, pressure, luminosity and relative humidity.

Using as  programming language Python, in the Raspberry, to stablish a connection to use the sensors,  few libraries were used to ease this process.

The used libraries are listed below, with their authors, which a give special thanks to them.

- AHTX0 : Andreas BÃ¼hl, Kattni Rembor
- BH1750 : flrrth
- BMP280 : David Stenwall Wahlund
